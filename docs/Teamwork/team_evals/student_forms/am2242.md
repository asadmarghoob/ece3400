# Qualitative Peer/Self Evaluation

### Name: Marghoob, Asad
### Team Number: 16

(1.) On a scale from 1(poor) to 5(great), please judge the overall performance of your team: 4

(2.) In the table below, identify a major strength of each of your group members in relation to the group’s goals and processes. Provide one concrete example to substantiate your answer. Include yourself!

| Group member's name | Strength | Example |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------- |
|Bandaru, Rohit|takes initiative with special interests|started algorithm coding two weeks before it was even assigned|
|Gurara, Firehiwot|very dedicated and ambitious|spends the most time on making sure everyone is up to task|
|Lee, Lois|helpful to other teammates|Lois often makes sure she is lending a helping hand to others; she made a graphic/helped on the lab report for people even if not on her subteam|
|Marghoob, Asad|communication|I feel I often guide the group in right direction as to what we need to do for the lab reports or what our next step should be|
|Nwosu, Jidenna|easy to work with|Jide is extremely collaborative and understanding, he will always listen and take into account all others' input before making a big decision|
|Sarnecki, John|strong technical know-how|usually takes John only a couple of seconds to understand the project's bugs or how to implement a function|

(3.) In the table below, identify a weakness of each of your group member’s in relation to the group’s process. Provide concrete examples to substantiate your answers. Include yourself!

| Group member’s name | Weakness | Example |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------- |
|Bandaru, Rohit|lack of structure|I have been on Rohit's subteam often, and I feel liek sometimes he will be very slow in enacting when and how we will ge things done, and never outlines our lab report in advance.|
|Gurara, Firehiwot|tunnel vision|Firehiwot will get very invested in her own task/subteam and not pay much attention to the greater project at hand.|
|Lee, Lois|stubborn|at times Lois does not take into account others' decisions/desires and will already have her mind set on her way|
|Marghoob, Asad|technical skills|I believe I can be better about trying to get better at programming/circuit design to become more of an asset and work more autonomously|
|Nwosu, Jidenna|complacency|at time, Jide will not be very invested in the project at hand if it does not pertain to him specifically|
|Sarnecki, John|lack of communication|John will very infrequently communciate how he is completing a task.|

(4.) In the space below, identify approaches your group tried that worked well, and explain why they were effective.

Overall, we do a good job of meeting when we agree to, as we work around people's schedules. This has been effective in making sure out tasks are complete in advance and that we do not fall behind.

(5.) In the space below, identify approaches your group tried that did not work well, and explain why they were ineffective.

We are not very goos at implementing our roles as well as we did at the beginning of the semester. When we often have trouble delegating tasks, it would have been a lot easier if it was already etched out in the form of the roles (quality assurance, leader, etc.)

(6.) What can you do to improve your own contributions to the group’s goals and processes in the final part of the semester?

I think I can become more invested in the detail-oriented portions of the lab. I want to understand the nitty gritty of the other subteam's tasks so I can become more fluent in how to bring it all together by the end of the semester.

(7.) Distribute points among the members of your team (not including you); a higher score means they have contributed more towards the team work. **The total points must sum to 1.**
*Example:
Alice: 0.25
Ben: 0.1
Charles: 0.25

### Scores:
